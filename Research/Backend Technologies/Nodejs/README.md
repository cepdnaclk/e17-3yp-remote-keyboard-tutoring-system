# Why Choose Node.Js For Backend Development?

## Intrduction

Before Node.js, javascript was only used for web application UI/UX (they are still even to this day). The primary reason was the continued support to run javascript within a browser. Introduced by Chrome, soon all other major browser vendors (Firefox, IE, Safari) started supporting this. Some developers used to call it a "toy language". But this concept vanished with the invention of Node.js.

 V8 provides the runtime environment in which JavaScript executes. Node warpped the V8 engine and allowed us to use javascript for various other applications. It was written in c++ by Ryan Dahl. With the introduction of it,  web app development has become extremely simple, cost-effective, and super efficient with JavaScript running on the server-side (rather than using it for client side developments).

## Why Use Node for Web Development

### **Offers High-performance for Real-time Applications -**
Web applications powered by Node.js benefit massively from its ability to multitask. Unlike other platforms, its single-threaded, event-driven architecture processes multiple concurrent requests efficiently without clogging the RAM. Moreover, its event-loop and non-blocking I/O operations allow code execution at a pace which significantly impacts the application’s overall performance.

### **Offers Easy Scalability for Modern Applications -**
The cutting-edge technology comes with tons of features like the cluster module. It facilitates load balancing over multiple CPU cores, making it easy to deliver desired outcomes through smaller modules without burning out the RAM process. Additionally, Node.js employs a non-blocking event-loop mechanism that offers high scalability and enables the server to process requests seamlessly.

### **It is Cost-effective -**
Since Node.js gives developers the opportunity to write server-side code in Javascript, we get to write codes on both the frontend and backend with absolute ease. This is one of the biggest node.js advantages as it crosses the barriers of hiring two resource teams besides saving a great deal of time, cost, and energy for overall project development.

### **Offers Community Support to Simplify Development -**
With millions of developers contributing actively to the Node.js community, you can expect extensive support from development experts across the globe to solve even the most peculiar development problems. NPM, a package manager for JavaScript, is the biggest package manager registry in the world. It offers numerous tools and libraries available readily for you to use in your project. (We'll be discussing more on the npm packages we'll be using in our project).

### **It is Easy to Learn and Quick to Adapt -**
Javascript is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages in the developer’s community. It is a lot easier to adapt and learn Node.js for web application development.

### **Improves App Response Time and Boosts Performance -**
with its single-threaded event-loop model, offers a non-blocking asynchronous architecture without creating more threads by employing fewer resources. This helps boost the responsiveness of your application since it can deal with multiple concurrent users simultaneously.

### **Helps in Building Cross-Platform Applications -**
With Node.js, you can leverage platforms like Electron and NW.js to build cross-platform real-time web applications. This means you no longer need to invest time behind writing separate codes for various desktop versions – Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## How Node.js Benefit Our Project

- Our server will be handling multiple online requests. Therefor it requires top-notch user experience and prompt response time. An I/O non-blocking model allows for serving multiple simultaneous requests, ensuring easy scaling and prompt execution of client requests on high-load platforms. 
  
- The runtime environment’s flexibility and responsiveness will benefit us with the increasing number of users.
- We'll be building our web app using react.js. So Node.js language will be spoken by both frontend and backend, which  makes for a more effective and better-coordinated working environment, and eliminates the need to explain how certain features work or what certain code means. Small projects can be handled by a single full-stack team, saving time and money. 

- We'll be needing plenty of services regarding to responsivness, security, etc. As Node is an open-source technology that does not require costly licensing, we can easily use its packages for our diverse development purposes. There are plenty of 3rd party packages to support development.
- There's a massive community behind Node so we'll be confident to carry out our work as there'll be plenty of developers who can help us when we face problems.
