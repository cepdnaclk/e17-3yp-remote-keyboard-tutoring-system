## What is a NoSQL Database ?
NoSQL database an alternative of conventional SQL Database and also, this type of database provides mostly all types of features which are normally available in the RDBMS systems. Now-a-days, NoSQL databases become much popular in comparison to the past due to the simple design, provision for both horizontal and vertical scaling and also for easy and simple control over the stored data. This type of database basically breaks the normal tradition of data storage structure of the relational database. It gives the provision to the developers to store data in the database as per the actual requirement of their program. This type of facility we canâ€™t achieve by using the traditional RDBMS database.

## What is MongoDB ?
MongoDB is one of the most popular open-source NoSQL database written in C++. It is a document-oriented database which stores data in JSON-like documents with dynamic schema. It means you can store your records without worrying about the data structure such as the number of fields or types of fields to store values. MongoDB documents are similar to JSON objects.

```json
{
    name : "Bob",
    age : 26,
    carrier : "Engineer",
    groups : ["Sports", "ML"]
}
```
There are large number of companies who are using MongoDB as a database service for the applications or data storage systems in today's industry.
Ex : IBM, Twitter, Sony

## How it Stores Data ?
MongoDB stores data in documents in-spite of tables. You can change the structure of records (which is called as documents in MongoDB) simply by adding new fields or deleting existing ones. This ability of MongoDB help you to represent hierarchical relationships, to store arrays, and other more complex structures easily. MongoDB provides high performance, high availability, easy scalability and out-of-the-box replication and auto-sharding.

## How MongoDB Benefit Our Project ?
- As the number of users for our product increase, it is very much practical to use MongoDB since it is very easy to scale up or down.
- MongoDB works on all types of cloud platforms. Since we'll be using aws to host our services MongoDB will be a great choice.
- As our product evolves we can evolve type of deployment of the database with MongoDB.
- As we can search, manage and store data text, geospatial, or time series dimensions it will increase the efficiency in our development process.
