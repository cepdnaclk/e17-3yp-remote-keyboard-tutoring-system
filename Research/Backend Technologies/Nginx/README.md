## How NGINX benefit Us ?
We will be using NGINX as a reverse proxy so that we can access it through http, https along with Let’s Encrypt to create and manage free validated SSL/TLS certificates. 

It’s well known that SSL/TLS encryption of your website leads to higher search rankings and better security for your users. However, there are a number of barriers that have prevented website owners from adopting SSL.Two of the biggest barriers have been the cost and the manual processes involved in getting a certificate. But now, with Let’s Encrypt, they are no longer a concern. Let’s Encrypt makes SSL/TLS encryption freely available to everyone.

### Let's Encrypt -
is a free, automated, and open certificate authority (CA). Certificates issued by Let’s Encrypt are trusted by most browsers today, including older browsers such as Internet Explorer on Windows XP SP3. In addition, Let’s Encrypt fully automates both issuing and renewing of certificates.
